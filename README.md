# ArrayExcercise
An excercise in coding Array


Create a class including a Main method that instantiates an array of int (previous slide).
Write methods (static) that do the following:
A method that returns the sum the elements in the array
A method that returns the average of the elements in the array
A method that returns the number of elements with the value 7 in the array
A method that returns true if the value 3 is contained in the array and false otherwise
Generalise your solution to exercise 2 and 3, so the value in question (7 and 3 resp.) is passed as an argument to the method.
For each method write driver code in the Main method that tests the method.
